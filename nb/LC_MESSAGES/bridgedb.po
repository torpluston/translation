#. : The path to the HTTPS distributor's web templates.  (Should be the
#. : "templates" directory in the same directory as this file.)
#. Setting `filesystem_checks` to False is recommended for production servers,
#. due to potential speed increases. This means that the atimes of the Mako
#. template files aren't rechecked every time the template is requested
#. (otherwise, if they are checked, and the atime is newer, the template is
#. recompiled). `collection_size` sets the number of compiled templates which
#. are cached before the least recently used ones are removed. See:
#. http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/usage.html#using-templatelookup
#. : Localisations which BridgeDB supports which should be rendered right-to-
#. left.
#. We use our metrics singleton to keep track of BridgeDB metrics such as
#. "number of failed HTTPS bridge requests."
