# 1. 为了隐私的Tor

### 隐私是一项人权

像我们中的许多人一样，Aleisha将大部分时间花在网上——与朋友联系，在社交媒体上发布以及浏览网页。

但是最近，她注意到与之前她搜索相关的广告在网上追踪她。

这种感觉非常具有侵略性，所以她对在线广告进行了一些研究，并了解到不仅是广告客户追踪她，还有她的服务商，分析公司，社交媒体平台等等也在追踪她。

Aleisha决定她要找到并使用不收集她数据，不跟踪她，也不会告诉其他服务任何关于她的私人信息的软件。

她参加了当地黑客空间的隐私培训，并了解到了**Tor Browser**，这是唯一能让她匿名浏览的网络浏览器。

# 2. 为了女权的Tor

### The future is cyberfeminist

Fernanda runs a women's collective focused on reproductive rights in Brazil, where abortion is illegal.

Fernanda and her colleagues built a website with information about abortion access, birth control, and other resources for people seeking reproductive information.

If this website was linked back to them, they could be arrested--or worse. 

To protect themselves, Fernanda and her colleagues created the website using Tor **onion services**. Onion services not only protect them from being discovered as the operators of the server but also help protect visitors to their website by requiring they use Tor Browser. 

In fact, Fernanda uses **Tor Browser** for all of her web browsing just to be on the safe side.

She also uses a Tor-powered app called **OnionShare** to send files to other activists securely and privately. 

### Reproductive rights activists like Fernanda are fighting for fundamental freedoms, and Tor helps power their resistance.

# 3. 为了人权的Tor

### 水是生命之源

Jelani lives in a small village  which a wide river runs through.

This river has provided water to his community since the days of his ancestors. 

But today, Jelani’s river is threatened by powerful multinational companies drilling for oil in the region.

Private security firms, paid for by these companies, use powerful surveillance mechanisms to monitor the online activities of Jelani and his neighbors in the village who are organizing to protect their sacred river. 

Jelani uses **Tor Browser** to prevent these companies from watching as he visits websites for international human rights protection and legal aid and writes blog posts about the resistance movement in his village.

He also uses **OnionShare** and **SecureDrop** to securely send documents to journalists who are helping expose these human rights violations.

All of this software uses Tor to help protect Jelani’s privacy. 

### Human rights activists like Jelani are fighting for justice in their communities, and Tor helps power their resistance.

# 4. 为了反审查的Tor

### 造桥而非建墙

Jean was traveling for the first time to a country far from his family.

After arriving at a hotel, he opened his laptop.

He was so exhausted that when the message "Connection has timed out" first appeared on his web browser, he thought it was due to his own error.

But after trying again and again, he realized that his email provider, a news website, and many apps were unavailable. 

He had heard that this country censors the internet and wondered if that was happening.
How could he contact his family from behind this impenetrable wall?
After doing some web searches, he found a forum and read about VPNs, private services that allow you to connect to another uncensored network.

Jean spent half an hour trying to figure out which cheap VPN was best.

He chose one and for a moment it seemed to work, but after five minutes the connection went offline and the VPN would no longer connect. 

Jean kept reading to find other options and learned about Tor Browser and how it can circumvent censorship.

He found an official website mirror to download the program.

When he opened **Tor Browser**, he followed the prompts for censored users and connected to a bridge which allowed him to access the internet again.

With Tor Browser, Jean can browse freely and privately and contact his family. 

### Censored users all over the world rely on Tor Browser for a free, stable, and uncensored way to access the internet.

## 什么是 Tor？

Tor是免费软件和开放式网络，有助于保护您免受在线跟踪，监控和审查。
Tor由一家名为Tor Project的501(c)3美国非营利组织免费创建。

使用Tor的最简单方法是Tor Browser。
当您使用Tor Browser时，没有人能够看到您访问的是哪个网站或您来自世界的哪个位置。

其他应用程序，如SecureDrop和OnionShare，使用Tor来保护其用户免受监视和审查。


## 6. How does Tor work?

Amal wants to visit Bekele’s website privately, so she opens Tor Browser.

Tor Browser selects a random circuit of three relays, which are computers all over the world configured to route traffic over the Tor network.

Tor Browser then encrypts her website request three times and sends it to the first Tor relay in her circuit.

The first relay removes the first encryption layer but doesn't learn that the destination is Bekele’s website.

The first relay learns only the next location in the circuit, which is the second relay.

The second relay removes another encryption layer and forwards the web page request to the third relay.

The third relay removes the last encryption layer and forwards the web page request to its destination, Bekele’s website, but it doesn't know the request comes from Amal.

Bekele doesn't know that the website request came from Amal unless she tells him so.

## 7. Who uses Tor? 

People all over the world use Tor to protect their privacy and access the web freely.

Tor helps protect journalists, human rights defenders, domestic violence victims, academic researchers, and anyone experiencing tracking, censorship, or surveillance. 

## 6. Why trust Tor?

Tor is designed for privacy. We don’t know who our users are, and we don't keep logs of user activity.

Tor relay operators cannot reveal the true identity of Tor users.

Continual peer review of Tor's source code by academic and open source communities ensures that there are no backdoors in Tor, and our social contract promises that we will never backdoor Tor.
