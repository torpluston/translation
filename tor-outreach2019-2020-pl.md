# 1. TOR DLA PRYWATNOŚCI

### Prawo do prywatności jest prawem człowieka. 

Tak jak wielu z nas, Aleisha większość czasu spędzanego online poświęca na kontakty ze znajomymi, postowanie w mediach społecznościowych i przeglądanie sieci.

But lately, she's noticed that advertisements related to her previous searches are following her around online.

This feels so invasive that she does some research on online ads and learns that it's not just advertisers tracking her but also her ISP, analytics companies, social media platforms, and more.

Aleisha decides she wants to find and use software that doesn't collect her data, doesn't track her, and doesn't tell other services anything private about her.

She goes to a privacy training at a local hackerspace and learns about **Tor Browser**, the only web browser that allows her to browse anonymously.

# 2.TOR DLA FEMINISTÓW

### Przyszłość to cyberfeministka

Fernanda prowadzi kolektyw kobiecy zajmujący się prawami reprodukcyjnymi w Brazylii, gdzie aborcja jest nielegalna.

Fernanda and her colleagues built a website with information about abortion access, birth control, and other resources for people seeking reproductive information.

Gdyby ta strona internetowa była z nimi powiązana, mogliby zostać aresztowani - lub gorzej.

To protect themselves, Fernanda and her colleagues created the website using Tor **onion services**. Onion services not only protect them from being discovered as the operators of the server but also help protect visitors to their website by requiring they use Tor Browser. 

In fact, Fernanda uses **Tor Browser** for all of her web browsing just to be on the safe side.

She also uses a Tor-powered app called **OnionShare** to send files to other activists securely and privately. 

### Reproductive rights activists like Fernanda are fighting for fundamental freedoms, and Tor helps power their resistance.

# 3. TOR DLA PRAWA CZŁOWIEKA

### Woda to życie

Jelani mieszka w małej wiosce, przez którą przepływa szeroka rzeka.

Ta rzeka dostarczała wodę jego społeczności od czasów jego przodków.

Jednak dziś rzeka Jelani jest zagrożona przez potężne międzynarodowe firmy, które poszukują ropy w regionie.

Prywatne firmy ochrony, opłacane przez te firmy, korzystają z potężnych mechanizmów nadzoru, aby monitorować działania online Jelaniego i jego sąsiadów we wsi, którzy organizują się w celu ochrony ich świętej rzeki.

Jelani używa przeglądarki **Tor Browser**, aby uniemożliwić tym firmom oglądanie, gdy odwiedza strony internetowe w celu ochrony międzynarodowej praw człowieka i pomocy prawnej, i pisze blogi o ruchu oporu w jego wiosce.

Używa również **OnionShare** i **SecureDrop** do bezpiecznego wysyłania dokumentów do dziennikarzy, którzy pomagają ujawnić te naruszenia praw człowieka.

Całe to oprogramowanie używa Tora, aby chronić prywatność Jelaniego.

### Obrońcy praw człowieka, tacy jak Jelani, walczą o sprawiedliwość w swoich społecznościach, a Tor pomaga zasilać ich opór.

# 4. TOR DLA ANTY-CENZURY

### Build bridges not walls

Jean was traveling for the first time to a country far from his family.

After arriving at a hotel, he opened his laptop.

He was so exhausted that when the message "Connection has timed out" first appeared on his web browser, he thought it was due to his own error.

But after trying again and again, he realized that his email provider, a news website, and many apps were unavailable. 

He had heard that this country censors the internet and wondered if that was happening.
How could he contact his family from behind this impenetrable wall?
After doing some web searches, he found a forum and read about VPNs, private services that allow you to connect to another uncensored network.

Jean spent half an hour trying to figure out which cheap VPN was best.

He chose one and for a moment it seemed to work, but after five minutes the connection went offline and the VPN would no longer connect. 

Jean kept reading to find other options and learned about Tor Browser and how it can circumvent censorship.

He found an official website mirror to download the program.

When he opened **Tor Browser**, he followed the prompts for censored users and connected to a bridge which allowed him to access the internet again.

With Tor Browser, Jean can browse freely and privately and contact his family. 

### Censored users all over the world rely on Tor Browser for a free, stable, and uncensored way to access the internet.

# 5. Shared Sections

## Czym jest Tor?

Tor is free software and an open network that helps protect you from tracking, surveillance, and censorship online.
Tor is created for free by a 501(c)3 U.S.-based nonprofit called the Tor Project. 

The easiest way to use Tor is Tor Browser.
When you use Tor Browser, no one can see what websites you visit or where in the world you’re coming from. 

Other applications, like SecureDrop and OnionShare, use Tor to protect their users against surveillance and censorship.


## 6. How does Tor work?

Amal wants to visit Bekele’s website privately, so she opens Tor Browser.

Tor Browser selects a random circuit of three relays, which are computers all over the world configured to route traffic over the Tor network.

Tor Browser then encrypts her website request three times and sends it to the first Tor relay in her circuit.

The first relay removes the first encryption layer but doesn't learn that the destination is Bekele’s website.

The first relay learns only the next location in the circuit, which is the second relay.

The second relay removes another encryption layer and forwards the web page request to the third relay.

The third relay removes the last encryption layer and forwards the web page request to its destination, Bekele’s website, but it doesn't know the request comes from Amal.

Bekele doesn't know that the website request came from Amal unless she tells him so.

## 7. Kto używa przeglądarki Tor?

People all over the world use Tor to protect their privacy and access the web freely.

Tor helps protect journalists, human rights defenders, domestic violence victims, academic researchers, and anyone experiencing tracking, censorship, or surveillance. 

## 6. Dlaczego warto zaufać przeglądarce Tor?

Tor is designed for privacy. We don’t know who our users are, and we don't keep logs of user activity.

Tor relay operators cannot reveal the true identity of Tor users.

Continual peer review of Tor's source code by academic and open source communities ensures that there are no backdoors in Tor, and our social contract promises that we will never backdoor Tor. 

## 7. Dołącz do społeczności Tor

Tor is made possible by a diverse set of users, developers, relay operators, and advocates from around the world.

We need your help to make Tor more usable and secure for people everywhere.

You can volunteer with Tor by writing code, running a relay, creating documentation, offering user support, or telling people in your community about Tor.

The Tor community is governed by a code of conduct, and we outline our set of promises to the community in our social contract. 

Learn more about Tor by visiting our website, our wiki, finding us on IRC, joining one of our mailing lists, or signing up for Tor News at newsletter.torproject.org.
