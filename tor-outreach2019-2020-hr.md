# 1. TOR ZA PRIVATNOST

### Privacy is a human right

Like many of us, Aleisha spends most of her time online--connecting with friends, posting on social media, and browsing the web.

But lately, she's noticed that advertisements related to her previous searches are following her around online.

This feels so invasive that she does some research on online ads and learns that it's not just advertisers tracking her but also her ISP, analytics companies, social media platforms, and more.

Aleisha decides she wants to find and use software that doesn't collect her data, doesn't track her, and doesn't tell other services anything private about her.

She goes to a privacy training at a local hackerspace and learns about **Tor Browser**, the only web browser that allows her to browse anonymously.

# 2.TOR FOR FEMINISTS 

### The future is cyberfeminist

Fernanda runs a women's collective focused on reproductive rights in Brazil, where abortion is illegal.

Fernanda and her colleagues built a website with information about abortion access, birth control, and other resources for people seeking reproductive information.

If this website was linked back to them, they could be arrested--or worse. 

To protect themselves, Fernanda and her colleagues created the website using Tor **onion services**. Onion services not only protect them from being discovered as the operators of the server but also help protect visitors to their website by requiring they use Tor Browser. 

In fact, Fernanda uses **Tor Browser** for all of her web browsing just to be on the safe side.

She also uses a Tor-powered app called **OnionShare** to send files to other activists securely and privately. 

### Reproductive rights activists like Fernanda are fighting for fundamental freedoms, and Tor helps power their resistance.

# 3. TOR FOR HUMAN RIGHTS

### Water is life 

Jelani lives in a small village  which a wide river runs through.

This river has provided water to his community since the days of his ancestors. 

But today, Jelani’s river is threatened by powerful multinational companies drilling for oil in the region.

Private security firms, paid for by these companies, use powerful surveillance mechanisms to monitor the online activities of Jelani and his neighbors in the village who are organizing to protect their sacred river. 

Jelani uses **Tor Browser** to prevent these companies from watching as he visits websites for international human rights protection and legal aid and writes blog posts about the resistance movement in his village.

He also uses **OnionShare** and **SecureDrop** to securely send documents to journalists who are helping expose these human rights violations.

All of this software uses Tor to help protect Jelani’s privacy. 

### Human rights activists like Jelani are fighting for justice in their communities, and Tor helps power their resistance.

# 4. TOR FOR ANTI-CENSORSHIP

### Build bridges not walls

Jean was traveling for the first time to a country far from his family.

After arriving at a hotel, he opened his laptop.

He was so exhausted that when the message "Connection has timed out" first appeared on his web browser, he thought it was due to his own error.

But after trying again and again, he realized that his email provider, a news website, and many apps were unavailable. 

He had heard that this country censors the internet and wondered if that was happening.
How could he contact his family from behind this impenetrable wall?
After doing some web searches, he found a forum and read about VPNs, private services that allow you to connect to another uncensored network.

Jean spent half an hour trying to figure out which cheap VPN was best.

He chose one and for a moment it seemed to work, but after five minutes the connection went offline and the VPN would no longer connect. 

Jean kept reading to find other options and learned about Tor Browser and how it can circumvent censorship.

He found an official website mirror to download the program.

When he opened **Tor Browser**, he followed the prompts for censored users and connected to a bridge which allowed him to access the internet again.

With Tor Browser, Jean can browse freely and privately and contact his family. 

### Censored users all over the world rely on Tor Browser for a free, stable, and uncensored way to access the internet.

# 5. Shared Sections

## Što je Tor?

Tor je besplatan softver i otvorena mreža koja štiti od praćenja, nadzora i cenzure na mreži.

Tor je besplatno stvoren od neprofitne 501(c)3 organizacije Tor Project sa sjedištem u SAD-u.

Tor se najlakše koristi putem Tor preglednika.
Kad koristiš Tor preglednik, nitko ne može vidjeti koje web-stranice posjećuješ ili od kuda dolaziš.

Ostali programi, poput SecureDrop i OnionShare, koriste Tor, kako bi zaštitili svoje korisnike od nadzora i cenzure.


## 6. How does Tor work?

Amal wants to visit Bekele’s website privately, so she opens Tor Browser.

Tor Browser selects a random circuit of three relays, which are computers all over the world configured to route traffic over the Tor network.

Tor Browser then encrypts her website request three times and sends it to the first Tor relay in her circuit.

The first relay removes the first encryption layer but doesn't learn that the destination is Bekele’s website.

The first relay learns only the next location in the circuit, which is the second relay.

The second relay removes another encryption layer and forwards the web page request to the third relay.

The third relay removes the last encryption layer and forwards the web page request to its destination, Bekele’s website, but it doesn't know the request comes from Amal.

Bekele doesn't know that the website request came from Amal unless she tells him so.

## 7. Tko koristi Tor? 

Ljudi diljem svijeta koriste Tor kako bi zaštitili svoju privatnost i slobodno pristupili internetu.

Tor pomaže zaštititi novinare, branitelje ljudskih prava, žrtve nasilja u obitelji, akademske istraživače i sve one koji su na vlastitoj koži iskusili praćenje, cenzuru ili nadzor.

## 6. Zašto se pouzdati u Tor?

Tor je stvoren za privatnost. Niti znamo tko su naši korisnici niti vodimo evidenciju o korisničkim aktivnostima.

Operatori Tor releja ne mogu otkriti pravi identitet korisnika Tora.

Akademska zajednica i zajednice otvorenog koda imaju stalan uvid u Torov izvorni kod i na taj način osiguravaju da u Toru nema skrivenih mogućnosti za manipuliranje podacima, a naš društveni ugovor obećava da to nikada nećemo dozvoliti u Toru.

## 7. Pridruži se Tor zajednici

Tor omogućuju razni skupovi korisnika, programera, operatora releja i zagovornika iz cijelog svijeta.

Trebamo tvoju pomoć kako bismo Tor učinili upotrebljivijim i sigurnijim za sve korisnike.

U Toru možeš volontirati pisanjem koda, pokretanjem releja, izradom dokumentacije, pružanjem korisničke podrške ili širenjem informacija o Toru.

Tor zajednica ima svoj kodeks ponašanja, a mi smo ocrtali naša obećanja zajednici u našem društvenom ugovoru.

Saznaj više o Toru na našoj web-stranici, na našim wiki-stranicama, pronađi nas na IRC-u, pridruži se nekoj od naših mailing lista ili se pretplati na Tor novosti na newsletter.torproject.org.
