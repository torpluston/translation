torbirdy.firstrun=You are now running TorBirdy.\n\nTo help protect your anonymity, TorBirdy will enforce the Thunderbird settings it has set, preventing them from being changed by you or by any add-on. There are some settings that can be changed and those are accessed through TorBirdy's preferences dialog. When TorBirdy is uninstalled or disabled, all settings that it changes are reset to their default values (the values prior to TorBirdy's install).\n\nIf you are a new user, it is recommended that you read through the TorBirdy website to understand what we are trying to accomplish with TorBirdy for our users.
