# 1. TOR PER LA PRIVACY

### La privacy è un diritto umano

Come molti di noi, Aleisha spende molto del suo tempo online--connettendosi con gli amici, postando sui social media e navigando in rete.

Ma più tardi, notò che le pubblicità relative alle sue ricerche precedenti la stavano seguendo in tutta la rete.

Fu così invasivo che fece alcune ricerche online circa gli ads e capì che non solo le pubblicità la tracciavano, ma anche il suo ISP, compagnie analitiche, piattaforme social media e altri.

Aleisha decide di voler cercare e usare un programma che non conservi i suoi dati, non la tracci, e non divulghi ad altri servizi nessuna informazione privata riguardo a lei.

Frequenta un corso sulla privacy in un hackerpace locale e scopre **Tor Browser**, l'unico browser web che le consente di navigare in modo anonimo.

# 2.TOR PER LE FEMMINISTE

### Il futuro è cyberfemminile

Fernanda gestisce un collettivo di donne incentrato verso i diritti riproduttivi in Brasile, dove l'aborto è illegale.

Fernanda e le sue colleghe hanno costruito un sito web con informazioni riguardo l'accesso all'aborto, il controllo delle nascite e altre risorse per le persone che cercano informazioni circa la riproduzione.

Se questo sito fosse stato collegato a loro, avrebbero rischiato l'arresto--o peggio.

per proteggersi, Fernanda e le sue colleghe crearono un sito usando Tor **onion services**. I servizi Onion non solo le protessero dall'essere scoperte come operatrici del server ma aiutarono a proteggere anche i visitatori del loro sito, richiedendo l'uso del Browser Tor.

Infatti, Fernanda usa **Tor Browser** per tutta la sua navigazione in rete solo per essere nel lato sicuro.

Usa anche una app di Tor chiamata **OnionShare** per inviare files algi altri attivisti in modo sicuro e privato.

### Attivisti per i diritti riproduttivi come Fernanda stanno combattendo per le libertà fondamentali e Tor aiuta a rafforzare la loro resistenza.

# 3. TOR PER I DIRITTI UMANI

### Water is life 

Jelani lives in a small village  which a wide river runs through.

This river has provided water to his community since the days of his ancestors. 

But today, Jelani’s river is threatened by powerful multinational companies drilling for oil in the region.

Private security firms, paid for by these companies, use powerful surveillance mechanisms to monitor the online activities of Jelani and his neighbors in the village who are organizing to protect their sacred river. 

Jelani uses **Tor Browser** to prevent these companies from watching as he visits websites for international human rights protection and legal aid and writes blog posts about the resistance movement in his village.

He also uses **OnionShare** and **SecureDrop** to securely send documents to journalists who are helping expose these human rights violations.

All of this software uses Tor to help protect Jelani’s privacy. 

### Human rights activists like Jelani are fighting for justice in their communities, and Tor helps power their resistance.

# 4. TOR FOR ANTI-CENSORSHIP

### Build bridges not walls

Jean was traveling for the first time to a country far from his family.

After arriving at a hotel, he opened his laptop.

He was so exhausted that when the message "Connection has timed out" first appeared on his web browser, he thought it was due to his own error.

But after trying again and again, he realized that his email provider, a news website, and many apps were unavailable. 

He had heard that this country censors the internet and wondered if that was happening.
How could he contact his family from behind this impenetrable wall?
After doing some web searches, he found a forum and read about VPNs, private services that allow you to connect to another uncensored network.

Jean spent half an hour trying to figure out which cheap VPN was best.

He chose one and for a moment it seemed to work, but after five minutes the connection went offline and the VPN would no longer connect. 

Jean kept reading to find other options and learned about Tor Browser and how it can circumvent censorship.

He found an official website mirror to download the program.

When he opened **Tor Browser**, he followed the prompts for censored users and connected to a bridge which allowed him to access the internet again.

With Tor Browser, Jean can browse freely and privately and contact his family. 

### Censored users all over the world rely on Tor Browser for a free, stable, and uncensored way to access the internet.

# 5. Shared Sections

## Cos'è Tor?

Tor is free software and an open network that helps protect you from tracking, surveillance, and censorship online.
Tor is created for free by a 501(c)3 U.S.-based nonprofit called the Tor Project. 

The easiest way to use Tor is Tor Browser.
When you use Tor Browser, no one can see what websites you visit or where in the world you’re coming from. 

Other applications, like SecureDrop and OnionShare, use Tor to protect their users against surveillance and censorship.


## 6. How does Tor work?

Amal wants to visit Bekele’s website privately, so she opens Tor Browser.

Tor Browser selects a random circuit of three relays, which are computers all over the world configured to route traffic over the Tor network.

Tor Browser then encrypts her website request three times and sends it to the first Tor relay in her circuit.

The first relay removes the first encryption layer but doesn't learn that the destination is Bekele’s website.

The first relay learns only the next location in the circuit, which is the second relay.

The second relay removes another encryption layer and forwards the web page request to the third relay.

The third relay removes the last encryption layer and forwards the web page request to its destination, Bekele’s website, but it doesn't know the request comes from Amal.

Bekele doesn't know that the website request came from Amal unless she tells him so.

## 7. Who uses Tor? 

People all over the world use Tor to protect their privacy and access the web freely.

Tor helps protect journalists, human rights defenders, domestic violence victims, academic researchers, and anyone experiencing tracking, censorship, or surveillance. 

## 6. Why trust Tor?

Tor is designed for privacy. We don’t know who our users are, and we don't keep logs of user activity.

Tor relay operators cannot reveal the true identity of Tor users.

Continual peer review of Tor's source code by academic and open source communities ensures that there are no backdoors in Tor, and our social contract promises that we will never backdoor Tor. 

## 7. Join the Tor community

Tor is made possible by a diverse set of users, developers, relay operators, and advocates from around the world.

We need your help to make Tor more usable and secure for people everywhere.

You can volunteer with Tor by writing code, running a relay, creating documentation, offering user support, or telling people in your community about Tor.

The Tor community is governed by a code of conduct, and we outline our set of promises to the community in our social contract. 

Learn more about Tor by visiting our website, our wiki, finding us on IRC, joining one of our mailing lists, or signing up for Tor News at newsletter.torproject.org.
