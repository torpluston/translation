# 1. تور برای محرمانگی

### حریم خصوصی یک حق انسانی است

مانند بسیاری از ما، Aleisha بیشتر وقت خود را به صورت آنلاین سپری می‌کند - - برقراری ارتباط با دوستان، ارسال وب سایت‌های ارتباط جمعی، و مرور وب.

اما اخیرا متوجه شده‌است که تبلیغات مربوط به جستجوهای گذشته او، او را به صورت آنلاین دنبال می‌کنند.

این به قدری تهاجمی است که برخی از تحقیقات را بر روی تبلیغات آنلاین انجام می‌دهد و یاد می‌گیرد که نه تنها تبلیغ کنندگان او بلکه ISP، شرکت‌های تجزیه و تحلیل، سکوهای رسانه اجتماعی و چیزهای دیگر را پی‌گیری می‌کنند.

Aleisha تصمیم می‌گیرد که به دنبال پیدا کردن و استفاده از نرم‌افزاری است که داده‌های او را جمع‌آوری نمی‌کند، او را ردیابی نمی‌کند، و هیچ چیز خصوصی در مورد او به دیگران نمی‌گوید.

او به یک تمرین خصوصی در یک هکر محلی می‌رود و در مورد مرورگر وب چیزی یاد می‌گیرد، تنها مرورگر وب که به او اجازه می‌دهد بدون نام مستعار مرور کند.

# 2.TOR FOR FEMINISTS 

### The future is cyberfeminist

فرناندا یک گروه از زنان را بر روی حقوق باروری در برزیل اداره می‌کند که در آن سقط‌جنین غیر قانونی است.

فرناندا و همکارانش یک وب سایت با اطلاعاتی درباره سقط‌جنین، کنترل تولد و سایر منابع برای افرادی که به دنبال اطلاعات تولید مثلی هستند، ساختند.

If this website was linked back to them, they could be arrested--or worse. 

To protect themselves, Fernanda and her colleagues created the website using Tor **onion services**. Onion services not only protect them from being discovered as the operators of the server but also help protect visitors to their website by requiring they use Tor Browser. 

In fact, Fernanda uses **Tor Browser** for all of her web browsing just to be on the safe side.

She also uses a Tor-powered app called **OnionShare** to send files to other activists securely and privately. 

### فعالین حقوق باروری مانند فرناندا، برای آزادی‌های اساسی مبارزه می‌کنند و تور به قدرت مقاومت آن‌ها کمک می‌کند.

# 3. تور برای حقوق بشر

### Water is life 

Jelani در روستایی کوچکی زندگی می‌کند که رودخانه وسیعی از آن عبور می‌کند.

این رودخانه از زمان اجدادش به جامعه خود آب داده‌است.

اما امروز، رودخانه Jelani توسط شرکت‌های چند ملیتی قدرتمند در حال حفاری نفت در منطقه مورد تهدید قرار گرفته‌است.

Private security firms, paid for by these companies, use powerful surveillance mechanisms to monitor the online activities of Jelani and his neighbors in the village who are organizing to protect their sacred river. 

Jelani uses **Tor Browser** to prevent these companies from watching as he visits websites for international human rights protection and legal aid and writes blog posts about the resistance movement in his village.

He also uses **OnionShare** and **SecureDrop** to securely send documents to journalists who are helping expose these human rights violations.

All of this software uses Tor to help protect Jelani’s privacy. 

### Human rights activists like Jelani are fighting for justice in their communities, and Tor helps power their resistance.

# 4. TOR FOR ANTI-CENSORSHIP

### Build bridges not walls

Jean was traveling for the first time to a country far from his family.

After arriving at a hotel, he opened his laptop.

He was so exhausted that when the message "Connection has timed out" first appeared on his web browser, he thought it was due to his own error.

But after trying again and again, he realized that his email provider, a news website, and many apps were unavailable. 

He had heard that this country censors the internet and wondered if that was happening.
How could he contact his family from behind this impenetrable wall?
After doing some web searches, he found a forum and read about VPNs, private services that allow you to connect to another uncensored network.

Jean spent half an hour trying to figure out which cheap VPN was best.

He chose one and for a moment it seemed to work, but after five minutes the connection went offline and the VPN would no longer connect. 

Jean kept reading to find other options and learned about Tor Browser and how it can circumvent censorship.

He found an official website mirror to download the program.

When he opened **Tor Browser**, he followed the prompts for censored users and connected to a bridge which allowed him to access the internet again.

With Tor Browser, Jean can browse freely and privately and contact his family. 

### Censored users all over the world rely on Tor Browser for a free, stable, and uncensored way to access the internet.

## تور چیست؟

Tor is free software and an open network that helps protect you from tracking, surveillance, and censorship online.
Tor is created for free by a 501(c)3 U.S.-based nonprofit called the Tor Project. 

The easiest way to use Tor is Tor Browser.
When you use Tor Browser, no one can see what websites you visit or where in the world you’re coming from. 

Other applications, like SecureDrop and OnionShare, use Tor to protect their users against surveillance and censorship.


## 6. How does Tor work?

Amal wants to visit Bekele’s website privately, so she opens Tor Browser.

Tor Browser selects a random circuit of three relays, which are computers all over the world configured to route traffic over the Tor network.

Tor Browser then encrypts her website request three times and sends it to the first Tor relay in her circuit.

The first relay removes the first encryption layer but doesn't learn that the destination is Bekele’s website.

The first relay learns only the next location in the circuit, which is the second relay.

The second relay removes another encryption layer and forwards the web page request to the third relay.

The third relay removes the last encryption layer and forwards the web page request to its destination, Bekele’s website, but it doesn't know the request comes from Amal.

Bekele doesn't know that the website request came from Amal unless she tells him so.

## 7. Who uses Tor? 

People all over the world use Tor to protect their privacy and access the web freely.

Tor helps protect journalists, human rights defenders, domestic violence victims, academic researchers, and anyone experiencing tracking, censorship, or surveillance. 

## 6. Why trust Tor?

Tor is designed for privacy. We don’t know who our users are, and we don't keep logs of user activity.

Tor relay operators cannot reveal the true identity of Tor users.

Continual peer review of Tor's source code by academic and open source communities ensures that there are no backdoors in Tor, and our social contract promises that we will never backdoor Tor. 

## 7. Join the Tor community

Tor is made possible by a diverse set of users, developers, relay operators, and advocates from around the world.

We need your help to make Tor more usable and secure for people everywhere.

You can volunteer with Tor by writing code, running a relay, creating documentation, offering user support, or telling people in your community about Tor.

The Tor community is governed by a code of conduct, and we outline our set of promises to the community in our social contract. 

Learn more about Tor by visiting our website, our wiki, finding us on IRC, joining one of our mailing lists, or signing up for Tor News at newsletter.torproject.org.
