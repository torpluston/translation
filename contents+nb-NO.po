"You may be curious about what prompted the faulty notice. It was likely "

"users to enhance their privacy, security, and safety online. It does not "
"host any content. Rather, it is part of a network of nodes on the Internet "
"that simply pass packets among themselves before sending them to their "
"destinations, just as any Internet intermediary does. The difference is that"
" Tor tunnels the connections such that no hop can learn both the source and "
"destination of the packets, giving users protection from nefarious snooping "
"on network traffic. The result is that, unlike most other Internet traffic, "
"the final IP address that the recipient receives is not the IP address of "
"the sender. Tor protects users against hazards such as harassment, spam, and"
" identity theft. Initial development of Tor, including deployment of a "
"public-use Tor network, was a project of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory,"
" with funding from ONR and DARPA. (For more on Tor, see "
