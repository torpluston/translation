"In the 1990s, the lack of security on the internet and its ability to be "
"used for tracking and surveillance was becoming clear, and in 1995, David "
"Goldschlag, Mike Reed, and Paul Syverson at the U.S. Naval Research Lab "
"(NRL), asked themselves if there was a way to create internet connections "
"that don’t reveal who is talking to whom, even to someone monitoring the "

"In the early 2000s, Roger Dingledine, a recent [Massachusetts Institute of "
"Technology (MIT)](https://web.mit.edu/) graduate, began working on an NRL "
"onion routing project with Paul Syverson. To distinguish this original work "
"at NRL from other onion routing efforts that were starting to pop up "
"elsewhere, Roger called the project Tor, which stood for The Onion Routing. "

"From its inception in the 1990s, onion routing was conceived to rely on a "
"decentralized network. The network needed to be operated by entities with "
"diverse interests and trust assumptions, and the software needed to be free "
"and open to maximize transparency and separation. That’s why in October 2002"
" when the Tor network was initially deployed, its code was released under a "
"free and open software license. By the end of 2003, the network had about a "
"dozen volunteer nodes, mostly in the U.S., plus one in Germany."
