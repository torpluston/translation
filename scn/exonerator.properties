footer.abouttor.body.text=Tor is an international software project to anonymize Internet traffic by %s.&nbsp; Therefore, if you see traffic from a Tor relay, this traffic usually originates from someone using Tor, rather than from the relay operator.&nbsp; The Tor Project and Tor relay operators have no records of the traffic that passes over the network and therefore cannot provide any information about its origin.&nbsp; Be sure to %s, and don't hesitate to %s for more information.

footer.aboutexonerator.heading=About ExoneraTor
footer.aboutexonerator.body=The ExoneraTor service maintains a database of IP addresses that have been part of the Tor network.&nbsp; It answers the question whether there was a Tor relay running on a given IP address on a given date.&nbsp; ExoneraTor may store more than one IP address per relay if relays use a different IP address for exiting to the Internet than for registering in the Tor network, and it stores whether a relay permitted transit of Tor traffic to the open Internet at that time.
